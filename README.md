# KAPFrontEnd - Clinical Application Frontend

Welcome to the KAPFrontEnd repository, the frontend component of the Klinisches Anwendungsprojekt (Clinical Application Project). This project is built with React, providing a user-friendly interface to interact with the clinical data resources served by the [backend server](https://github.com/aaron3636/KAP).

## Abstract
This project was an educational endeavor aimed at designing and implementing a medical application for managing patients and their observations. The primary objectives were to apply and extend our knowledge in software development, particularly focusing on the application structuring, basic security implementation, and understanding the usage of Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR). The application aimed to provide a practical solution to streamline patient management, specifically addressing certain use cases within the healthcare field. Throughout the process, we learned essential skills in defining a workflow, reflecting on the complexities and the interrelation of tasks within a software project. The experience gleaned from this project sheds light on the real-world application of theoretical knowledge in a highly critical field like healthcare and contributes to our practical proficiency in software development.

## Getting Started

To get started with the KAPFrontEnd, follow these steps:

1. **Install Node.js:**
   Before installing npm, you need to have Node.js installed on your machine. npm is the default package manager that comes with Node.js. If you don't have Node.js installed, you can download and install it from the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org/

2. **Verify Installation:**
   After installing Node.js, you can check if npm is installed by opening your terminal or command prompt and running the following commands:
   ```
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```
   These commands will display the installed versions of Node.js and npm, respectively.

Once you have successfully installed and set up npm, you can proceed with the installation steps for the KAPFrontEnd repository: 

1. **Clone / Start the server:**
   - Follow the steps provided [here](https://github.com/aaron3636/KAP) to clone and start the backend server.
   - Alternatively, you can download the built and ready-to-use server directly from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pery1-VEiU5qInV35zOIW4Vb3jjmPfdU?usp=drive_link).

2. **Clone the Repository:** Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/aaron3636/KAPFrontEnd.git
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using npm:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the Development Server:** Start the development server by running the following command:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   The app will be accessible at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

By following these steps, you will have both the backend server and the frontend application up and running, enabling seamless interaction with the clinical data resources. Should you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out. Happy testing!

## Available Scripts

In the KAPFrontEnd project directory, you can use the following scripts:

- `npm start`: Runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. The page will reload automatically if you make edits.

- `npm test`: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. Use this for testing your application.

- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. The production build is optimized for better performance.

- `npm run eject`: This is a one-way operation and should be used with caution. It allows you to have full control over the build tool and configuration choices. Note that this is not recommended for small and middle deployments.
